## Announcing new Personal Access Token UI along with `bh` 0.2.0 release

New addition of dispatch inputs to the workflow must go hand in hand with the ability to dispatch
inputs using the `bh` CLI. However, implementing this feature I noticed that handling personal access
tokens is suboptimal, and the interface was quite bad. So I decided to rework the current PAT token implementation,
along with the newest addition to this release.

New PAT is in the same format, it is completely backwards compatible, and you shouldn't see any disruptions
with your old PAT. But the UI is much simpler, and allows now re-generation of the same token, along with
token expiry dates.

New scopes are added, but are not yet part of the `bh` tool since I'm not yet sure how to properly output it.

If you have any ideas, please submit a [feature request](https://github.com/bountyhub-org/bh/issues/new), 
submit [feedback](https://forms.gle/2xtWVJENLAf3XJjA9), or let me know via an e-mail.

It never hurts to mention that [support page](https://bountyhub.org/support) is built, so you can easily
find links that you need.

Important thing to mention is that new `bh` release comes with the `env` fallback. All `env`s are prefixed
with `BOUNTYHUB_` which serves as a namespace, so they don't override your common environment variables.

Having said that, new runner will be released soon, and will expose these environment variables for each step.
This would massively simplify download steps where mostly, you would just have to specify the `-j` flag and the
`-o` flag.

Preview:

```bash
# Old usage
bh job download -p ${{ project.id }} -w ${{ workflow.id }} -r ${{ revision.id }} -j ${{ scans.subfinder[0].id }} -o output.zip
# New and shiny use
bh job download -j ${{ scans.subfinder[0].id }} -o output.zip
```

As always, happy hunting!

## Runner version 0.3.0 is released

Along with the [Major back-end release](#major-back-end-release), new runner release is created.

Packages are updated, inputs are well understood, and logs are correctly propagated! 

[Try it out](https://github.com/bountyhub-org/runner/releases/tag/0.3.0)!

## Major back-end release ðŸ”¥

After few weeks of hacking of trying out different approaches to scan attack surface, I noticed
that if scans last too long, logs won't be propagated properly. This is also true if the network
connectivity is interrupted, causing issues to continue streaming logs to the back-end.

Therefore, entire new way of log streaming has been created. Log lines are now periodically
propagated from the runner as JSON array, and slowly appended to the logs. This way, it is much
easier to add retries, cover failure cases, or simply, continue to build up log until back-end
flushes it to the storage.

Another **HUGE** feature is having dispatch inputs finally available. Now, you should be able to
define on-demand scans that accept inputs. This feature is intended to be used both from the UI,
and from the `bh` tool once it is released.

## Runner version 0.2.2 is released

New runner has been [released](https://github.com/bountyhub-org/runner/releases/tag/0.2.2) ðŸŽ‰!

This release comes with the fix to `is_available`, and the fix to the `cellang` package that
fixed something like `scans.subfinder.filter(x, x.state == 'succeeded')[0].id`.

This fix includes updates to internal packages to its latest version. To be honest, `is_available` and
`cellang` update is enough for the new release ðŸ˜Š.

In the future, auto-update should be implemented. However, workflow validation is prioritized at this time,
and the fixes related to the UI experience. Having said that, it doesn't hurt to re-mention the
feedback form you can fill [here](https://forms.gle/2xtWVJENLAf3XJjA9).

## Improved performance of Bhlast DNS servers

While using the server, a 5-second delay was noticed that could potentially be the duration between
you finding a bug and request timing out. That wouldn't be a too much of an issue since the DNS interactions
are recorded regardless of the cancelation. However, if the DNS lookup was made so HTTP(s) request could
be issued, some clients might time out before the request is completely done.

Therefore, the DNS server is completely refactored to improve performance. Few additional handlers are added
for IPv6, and ANY lookup is completely disabled.

Please submit an issue if you find that ANY lookup is needed. It is deprecated for quite some time now, and it is
usually used by adversaries for DNS amplification attack. Therefore, this query type is completely removed.

There is more room for improvement that I know of right now, however, current performance seems perfectly good.
To avoid introducing complexity to the service, and to prioritize more important things, I decided not to go
further with optimizations. If you disagree, I'm always here to chat!

## Feedback form is live and ready for your feedback!

Feedback form is live and ready for your feedback! You can find it [here](https://forms.gle/2xtWVJENLAf3XJjA9).

Please fill it out, so I can improve the platform and make it more useful for you!

## Runner version 0.2.1 is released

New runner has been [released](https://github.com/bountyhub-org/runner/releases/tag/0.2.1) ðŸŽ‰!

After publishing the [cellang](https://crates.io/crates/cellang) crate which is an interpreter for the CEL language,
the runner is now using it to evaluate the expressions. The purpose of this is to expose lower level primitives
associated with CEL language, so they can later be used to validate the workflow or provide an LSP.

This change is not a breaking change, since the library is simply a drop-in replacement for the previous one.
If you encounter any issues, please report them on the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/bountyhub-org/runner/issues).
You can also revert to the previous version since the change is not breaking.

## Runner version 0.2.0 is released

New runner has been [released](https://github.com/bountyhub-org/runner/releases/tag/0.2.0) ðŸŽ‰!

This release contains major refactor on client to be able to refresh the session. The session token is switched from JWT to random UUID v4. There are two session tokens used by the runner:
1. **Runner session token** - Used by the runner to request jobs and keep it alive.
2. **Worker session token** - Used by the runner worker to resolve the job and execute it.

Since there are different use-cases for them, each session token have a different lifetime.

Runner session token lasts for 30 days. If your runner is kept offline for more than 30 days, you will have to
re-register the runner.

Worker session token lasts for 4 hours. This should be enough time for the worker to finish the job. If job gets
stuck, session token would expire which would cancel the job and release the runner to pick up other jobs in case
there is a bug in a workflow.


## Billing is almost done

I'm currently opening a company based in US. Until the bank account is opened, I cannot meaningfully implement
any meaningful plans and charges. However, everyone is assigned a free plan. Plan management is implemented, so
it is possible to reach out if you need a better plan before the billing is completely done.

Please do not shy away to ask for a better plan. Once bank account is opened and billing is done, there will be
a period of 30 days before I connect the billing to the bank account, so you can always decide to downgrade your plan.

## Runner is now open-sourced

It was always intention to open-source the runner, however, the design and the protocol between the runner and the server was not stable enough to open source it.

The design of the runner (code-wise) is stable enough now, so open-sourcing it is the next logical step.

This is not to say that the protocol cannot change in the future. But it is unlikely to be modified in the near future.

Take a look and leverage [GitHub issues](https://github.com/bountyhub-org/runner/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/bountyhub-org/runner/discussions) to help me and others improve the service.

## SSE (Server-Sent Events) are available now

New SSE functionality is implemented to have live updates on the site.

This is especially important when you want to `dispatch` the workflow, or when you are
waiting for some job to finish.

It also tracks live interactions with your `bhlast` server,
so you can see interactions happening while you are on the page.

## New `bhlast` servers instead of `callback` ones

For the purpose of replacing burp collaborator, new `bhlast.com` domain is purchased.
The intention is to have server live all the time, to keep track of any blind payload executions,
second-order calls caused in asynchronous back-end systems, DNS interactions and more.

This project is heavily influenced by an amazing work on [interactsh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh).

Since the intention of the platform is to automate the boring stuff, provisioning your server can be done with a
click of the button! And please where with me or with others if this new feature helped you find your bounty!

## API changes

Since the platform is in beta stage, breaking changes are to be expected. To communicate that
the API is still unstable, the version of the API is changed from `/v1` to `/v0`.

Tooling for the API change is also updated to reflect this change.

Important thing to note is that `bh` tool is re-released under the `0.1.0` tag. The reason for it
is that the tool is currently used only by me, so I wanted to eliminate confusion where the
previously released versions `0.1.0` and `0.2.0` are deprecated. This won't happen in the future
since the `bh` tool is now released in [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bh).

## New bh tool has been released

The new tool officially supported has been released to talk to the BountyHub API.

The tool is open-sourced, and the code is available [here](https://github.com/bountyhub-org/bh).

It comes with installation instructions, and the future releases will be released under `0.x.x` version. This will be true until the platform has the stable API (i.e. the platform is out of `beta`).

All examples in the docs are updated to use this tool. Looking forward to your feedback!

## New workflow syntax has been released

The original workflow syntax was not powerful enough especially if you want to diff the previous invocations of the scan.
You would have to workaround the issue, and the workaround was not pretty.

The new syntax is related to expressions:

- The workflow `on.expr` now accepts the CEL based syntax.
- The `scans.[ID].steps[].if` is also moved to accept CEL expressions.
- Template is much powerful now, where the template is also a CEL expression that evaluates to string.

Most importantly, the expression engine now accepts the context, which is passed by the server. This requires a new
version of the runner. Since the change is the breaking one, the new runner is also released under the 0.1.0 tag.

Since the service was not yet officially announced, the change was overwritten to avoid having newcomers running the old, outdated version.

The most important thing is that syntax right now is much more stable and much more powerful. This change will allow further extensions on the workflow, such as continuing the run even if some steps are failing.

Along with the runner, new `bh` tool is about to be released. Currently, it only allows downloading the results, which is enough for the runner to do its job. I'm not yet sure how to best distribute it, and your feedback will be very valuable.

One of the reasons this service is not yet announced to the broad audience is, so we can figure out the pain points with the smaller audience, and based on your feedback, we can build stuff that is more stable.

I would encourage joining the [weekly call](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?height=600&wkst=1&ctz=Europe/Belgrade&bgcolor=%23ffffff&src=Y180ZjZmOWQyYTlkYmMzYjliNDc4MGQwN2Q0MTYxNmJmODE0ZjM2ODQ5NTY4NDM3ZjUwMjhkNjUzMTE5NWI2ZmZjQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20&color=%238E24AA). This is the best way to get to know each other and to communicate face-to-face the issues you are having.

Lastly, please keep an eye on announcements. The new tool will be released soon and unfortunately, until then, you won't be able to create dependencies between scans. But I can promise that you won't wait long! With the new tool, the runner documentation will also be improved, and more examples will be added to make it easier to maintain your runner installation.

Thank you for using this platform!

## Callback servers and payloads

New features are added to help find blind vulnerabilities. You can now register the server and listen to interactions to catch blind vulnerabilities. Server is listening on HTTP and HTTPS ports and is basically always live! Read more about this feature [here](https://docs.bountyhub.org/callback-servers/about).

Also, payloads are added to have a single place where you store payloads. Variables are also added, so you can replace and copy them quickly. Read more about payloads [here](https://docs.bountyhub.org/payloads/about).

Check it out! And please, do not hesitate to provide feedback ðŸ˜Š!

## BountyHub is in Alpha

BountyHub is now in alpha version. There are a lot of missing pieces and likely bugs, but hopefully, you will stick with it, and it is going to be awesome! For any feature requests, please submit a support ticket or e-mail me at [nikola.jokic@bountyhub.org](mailto:nikola.jokic@bountyhub.org).

There is also a [weekly call](https://bountyhub.org/bountyhub#meet). Feel free to join!
