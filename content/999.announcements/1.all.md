# Announcements

## Callback servers and payloads

New features are added to help find blind vulnerabilities. You can now register the server and listen to interactions to catch blind vulnerabilities. Server is listening on HTTP and HTTPS ports and is basically always live! Read more about this feature [here](https://docs.bountyhub.org/callback-servers/about).

Also, payloads are added to have a single place where you store payloads. Variables are also added, so you can replace and copy them quickly. Read more about payloads [here](https://docs.bountyhub.org/payloads/about).

Check it out! And please, do not hesitate to provide feedback ðŸ˜Š!

## BountyHub is in Alpha

BountyHub is now in alpha version. There are a lot of missing pieces and likely bugs, but hopefully, you will stick with it, and it is going to be awesome! For any feature requests, please submit a support ticket or e-mail me at [nikola.jokic@bountyhub.org](mailto:nikola.jokic@bountyhub.org).

There is also a [weekly call](https://bountyhub.org/bountyhub#meet). Feel free to join!
