# Bhlast

## Motivation

Blind attacks are somewhat difficult, since you have to have a server that will listen to interactions.

Burp collaborator is a great way to listen to interactions, but if you want your server to listen to interactions even when you are not hacking, you have to use some other site. 

ProjectDiscovery published an amazing tool called [interactsh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh), which allows you to self-host it to leverage some features.

Since this platform is meant to eliminate as much of the boring work that you need to do in order to be successful, and to work on the stuff while you are not hacking, having this functionality is a **must**.

Thank you ProjectDiscovery for open-sourcing this great tool! Bhlast implementation is heavily influenced by your work.

## How it works?

New server is registered behind the [bhlast.com](https://bhlast.com) domain.

In order to create your unique server, you have to have an account on the [BountyHub](https://bountyhub.org) platform.

Each server gets random subdomain unique to your account. In order to avoid having spam notifications, please do not share your
`bhlast` server publically. Every interaction with this server will be tracked, and you will get notified for no good reason.

Server is listening on following:

- HTTP (TCP port 80)
- HTTPS (TCP port 443)
- DNS (TCP and UDP port 53)
- Serve static files
- Get notified on interactions

## Default behavior

### HTTP

When you visit the [bhlast.com](https://bhlast.com), static page will be displayed. This static page is only used to point you to the documentation, and to show basic information about this server.

### DNS

Each `bhlast` server gets its own subdomain. Each subdomain is unique random lowercase alphanumeric string. Every interaction with that subdomain will be recorded.

By default, you will also get following subdomains:

- aws.\[id\].bhlast.com -> 169.254.169.254
- alibaba.\[id\].bhlast.com -> 100.100.100.200
- localhost.\[id\].bhlast.com -> 127.0.0.1
- oracle.\[id\].bhlast.com -> 127.0.0.1

## Server registration and configuration

### Registration

Once you are logged into the platform, on the right drawer, you will see tab named `Bhlast servers`. Click on it.

On top of the page, you will see `Register Server` button. Click on it, and you will be taken to the registration page.

## Working with your server

Your `bhlast` server can be used to:
- Track interactions
- Serve files

### Tracking interactions

Interactions are shown for each request that is associated with your subdomain. Interactions are updated live. Every interaction on the child domain from your subdomain is also tracked, in case you need to evade some filters or firewalls.
