# Bhlast

## Motivation

Blind attacks are somewhat difficult, since you have to have a server that will listen to interactions.

Burp collaborator is a great way to listen to interactions, but if you want your server to listen to interactions even when you are not hacking, you have to use some other site. 

ProjectDiscovery published an amazing tool called [interactsh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh), which allows you to self-host it to leverage some features.

Since this platform is meant to eliminate as much of the boring work that you need to do in order to be successful, and to work on the stuff while you are not hacking, having this functionality is a **must**.

Thank you ProjectDiscovery for open-sourcing this great tool! Bhlast implementation is heavily influenced by your work.

## How it works?

New server is registered behind two domains:

- [bhlast.com](https://bhlast.com)
- [bhlast.online](https://bhlast.online)

In the rest of the document, wherever `bhlast.com` is used also works for `bhlast.online`.

In order to create your unique server, you have to have an account on the [BountyHub](https://bountyhub.org) platform.

When you start creating your own server, you will be prompted with the yaml configuration file, along with notifications drawer you can use to get notified about interactions.

Each server gets random subdomain unique to your account. In order to avoid having spam notifications, please do not share your bhlast server publically. Every interaction with this server will be tracked, and you wll get notified for no good reason.

Server is listening on following:

- HTTP (TCP port 80)
- HTTPS (TCP port 443)
- DNS (TCP and UDP port 53)
- Serve static files
- Get notified on interactions

## Default behavior

### HTTP

When you visit the [bhlast.com](https://bhlast.com), static page will be displayed. This static page is only used to point you to the documentation, and to show basic information about this server.

### DNS

Each bhlast server gets its own subdomain. Each subdomain is unique random lowercase alphanumeric string. Every interaction with that subdomain will be recorded.

By default, you will also get following subdomains:

- aws.\[id\].bhlast.com -> 169.254.169.254
- alibaba.\[id\].bhlast.com -> 100.100.100.200
- localhost.\[id\].bhlast.com -> 127.0.0.1
- oracle.\[id\].bhlast.com -> 127.0.0.1

## Server registration and configuration

### Registration

Once you are logged into the platform, on the right drawer, you will see tab named `Bhlast servers`. Click on it.

On top of the page, you will see `Register Server` button. Click on it, and you will be taken to the registration page.

### Configuration

Configuration is separated into multiple sections:

- Notifications - what channels would you like to use to be notified when interaction is spotted on your subdomain
- YAML configuration - configuration contains special cases used by your server to handle specific request

#### Configuration format

Each server contains an object that will specify special behavior that needs to be applied.
