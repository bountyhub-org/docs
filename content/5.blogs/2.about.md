# About

The intention of this page is for you to write something about you. It does not have to be in form of a CV, but it can be. The intention of this page is to show other users who you are, and what you are interested in.

## Writing about yourself

About page uses the same editor as the blog posts. It contains the same constraints as the blog posts, and it is saved as HTML. It does not allow styling, to make uniform look and feel of the about pages.
