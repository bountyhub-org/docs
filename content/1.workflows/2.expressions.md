# Expressions

Expressions are implemented as a limited mechanism where you express when some action should be taken.

Currently, expressions are part of job scheduling, and step conditional execution.

## Syntax

Syntax is very limited and targeted to this app only, to allow expressive descriptions. It consists of multiple boolean statements.

Statements are always in form of: `<identifier> is <trigger>`.

Identifier represents a scan name.

Trigger is the event state used to evaluate if the scan or the step should be executed. Triggers are:

- *none*: Means that the scan is not executed yet. In other words, there are no successful jobs executed for this particular scan.
- *done*: A scan is *done* when there exists at least one successful run.
- *diff*: A scan is *diff* if results of the latest 2 successful jobs are different. Jobs that don't contain `uploads` field cannot be diff.

Now we get to the interesting part: combining multiple expressions. 

Expressions can be grouped using `()`, and between them, you can use `or` and `and`. The `and` has a higher precedence than the `or`, so please be careful when you specify the expression. For example, expression `scan1 is done or scan2 is done and scan3 is diff`. This is equivalent to `(scan1 is done) or (scan2 is done and scan3 is diff)`.

Let's put it all together:

```yaml
scans:
    scan1:
        # ...
    scan2:
        # ...
    scan3:
        # ...
    scan4:
      on:
        expr: (scan1 is done or scan2 is diff) and scan3 is done

      steps:
        - if: scan1 is done
          run: echo "Executes only if scan1 is done"
          shell: bash
        - if: scan2 is none or scan1 is none
          run: |
            echo "scan1 may be none while scan2 is diff."
            echo "scan2 may be none while scan1 is done."
            echo "But this still can execute to cover cases when you want to conditionally run something"
          shell: bash
```
