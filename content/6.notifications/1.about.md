# Notifications

The idea behind notifications is, so you can be notified on certain events that may be of interest to you. They may originate from

- Jobs:
  - Workflow failures
  - New content on the same scan
- Support:
  - Any interaction on the support ticket.

The idea behind it is for you to be notified each time a scan returns something different, so you can be one of the first ones to test a new subdomain,
port, or functionality on the site.

Similarly, if workflow starts failing, it can indicate either a bug in the tooling, or a change on the site which causes scan to fail. If a subdomain is suddenly
deleted, maybe there is another one, and you should start the subdomain discovery. Or maybe the rest of your workflow cannot proceed because of the bug in a workflow.

The idea is for you to be busy hunting, and only spend as little time as possible gathering information.

## E-mails

These are e-mail addresses that you can use to be notified on, and can be different from your primary e-mail address. Primary e-mail address is only used for profile related actions, such as password reset etc.

On the other hand, notification e-mails are only used, so you can be notified about events. You can duplicate your primary e-mail address.

**You cannot use it to sign in or any other profile related action**.

## Slacks

Slack notifications are based on the BountyHub App. To register the app, you should follow these steps:

1. Visit your profile. Under `Notifications` section, you can see `Add BountyBot to Slack`.
2. Click on the `Add BountyBot to Slack` button. The dialog box should open up, asking you to enter the name.
The name is human-readable name you want to assign to the slack installation.
3. Once you picked the name, you should be redirected to slack.
4. Pick the workspace you want to install the Slack app on.
5. Once you confirm, you will be redirected back to BountyHub.
6. After it, you should see the slack installation on your profile.

The important thing to point out is that application is being configured with following permissions:

- `chat:write`
- `chat:write.public`

## Discord

Discord notifications are delivered using integrations and webhook URLs. This is the easiest way for users to configure
their Discord integration with only few clicks.

To register it, you should:

1. Visit your discord server.
2. Click on the gear icon, or right-click on the channel, then `Edit Channel`.
3. Go to `Integrations > Webhooks > New Webhook`
4. Once created, click on `Copy Webhook URL`.
5. Go to BountyHub's Profile page under
6. Click on `Add BountyBot to Discord`.
7. Enter the name and the webhook URL, and that is it.
