# Runner upgrade

To update your runner to the latest release, starting from version `0.5.0`, new command has been added.

To upgrade the runner, you can run the following command:

```shell
./runner upgrade
```

The command would fetch the latest release, and upgrade the runner to the latest version,
replacing the current runner binary with the new one.

You can also re-install the runner by hand, but this command is provided for your convenience.
