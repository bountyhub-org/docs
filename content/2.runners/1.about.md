## Motivation

Most people doing bug bounties or penetration testing are running some VPS box where they have faster internet access or tooling installed
to avoid black-listing.

With that in mind, the runner running as a process on the VPS can also have access to those tools. BountyHub allows leveraging your machine to actually do the work in the background, while storing results on the server accessible to you from any machine.

If you don't want your result uploaded (for example, screenshots) just write it to a known directory on your system. Once you ssh into your
VPS, you can download it.

Another good way of leveraging your VPS is when you are running Caido for example. You can configure tools to pass traffic through proxy tools
which saves those results while leveraging automation.

## Runner

Runner is an agent executing workflows. You can start it on your home machine, or a VPS and leave it running.

The server will notify your runner when there is a workflow ready to be executed. The runner does not act as a server,
so it is safe to leave it running. The runner also does not come with pre-defined dependencies. As long as you have tools visible to the runner, you can run any tool you want. If you have custom tools, that is fine. The platform is basically controlled RCE. You run anything you'd like, and you upload stuff to the server if you want to.

### Registration

Runners need to be registered in order to execute tasks. It helps mitigate secret information passed from the platform. But you can also leverage
in-runner environment variables. There is no right or wrong approach here. Use one you feel the most comfortable with.

To register your runner, visit your profile, and under `Runners` tab, click `New Runner`.

Copy commands related to the registration and paste them on your VPS server. Once the runner is able to register itself against the server, it will start right away.

### Deletion

You can remove your runners from your profile. Keep in mind that the runner keeps the registration information in `.runner` file. If you remove it, you will have to register another runner.

### Workdir

Workdir or working directory is the base directory from which runner operates. Once a job is received, it will use this directory to write temporary files, create subdirectories within, etc.

After each job, the directory is cleaned up. Each job starts in a fresh workdir. This means that the runner runs only one scan at the time. The reason behind this decision is that if two scans land on the same runner, and target the same server, the runner may initiate a large amount of traffic directed to your target. That can result in blacklisting, or causing accidental DoS.

### Stdout and Stderr

Everything streamed to the `stdout` will be uploaded to the platform if the step results in exit code 0.

Otherwise, `stderr` will be stored on the server, and you will be able to view it on the [bountyhub.org](https://bountyhub.org)

## Limitations

Currently, runner application is only supported on the Linux platform. This may change in the future based on the feedback.

Having said that, it is not impossible to compile it to run on Windows platforms. The runner is written in Rust, but it is not
tested on the Windows platform and, thus, not officially supported.
