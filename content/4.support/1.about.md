## Support

The user interface (UI) is designed to handle tickets and facilitate communication regarding issues related to both the runner and the platform in general.

During the Alpha and Beta phase of the platform, if you encounter difficulties while submitting a ticket, you can alternatively email `nikola.jokic@bountyhub.org`. However, please only use this method if the original support functionality is not functioning as expected, as it can greatly assist stabilizing this feature and using it in the future.

The issue board is private and accessible only to you and the internal team working on the issue. Keeping issues private helps in effectively communicating potentially sensitive information.

You can also delete the ticket if you feel like the information on the ticket should not be shown. Most of the application works with hard deletes, meaning that the record is not marked as deleted, but is actually erased from the database. Same as with every other delete, use this with caution.
